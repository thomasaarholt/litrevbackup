What is the difference between Corrosion and Oxidation?

They find intermediate oxides with compositions close to ZrO

When/What is the kinetic transition? To Oxide? What is a suboxide?

It is the development of interlinked porosity down to the metal/oxide
interface that is the reason for the transition in oxidation kinetics.

\textbf{But what is the kinetic transition?}

The kinetics of high temperature oxidation are similar for oxygen, air,
water or steam! {[}3,6,8{]}

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item
  Short but rapid period oxidation
\item
  Period or periods of decreasing corrosion rate
\item
  Abrupt acceleration in rate aka transition/breakaway/breakdown
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Pre-transition}

Rate is either parabolic (like diffusion limited -\textgreater{}
x=sqrt{[}t{]}) or cubic (wtf) .
