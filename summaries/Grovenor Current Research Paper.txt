What is the difference between Corrosion and Oxidation?

They find intermediate oxides with compositions close to ZrO

When/What is the kinetic transition? To Oxide? What is a suboxide?

It is the development of interlinked porosity down to the metal/oxide interface that is the reason for the transition in oxidation kinetics.

**But what is the kinetic transition?**


The kinetics of high temperature oxidation are similar for oxygen, air, water or steam! [3,6,8]

1. Short but rapid period oxidation
2. Period or periods of decreasing corrosion rate
3. Abrupt acceleration in rate aka transition/breakaway/breakdown

Pre-transition
-----
Rate is either parabolic (like diffusion limited -> x=sqrt[t]) or cubic (wtf) .
