\label{workplanforliteraryreviewwriting}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write what I learn using FountainPen

\item Export it to Latex and use \emph{that} to organise my writing into chapters and sections

\item Save my work to github as version control. How do i automate github between computers?

I can write code like this. Code is cool. Markdown is cool.

\end{enumerate}
